# Rock Paper Scissors in Python
### A electronic take on a classic game!
#### Pick your weapon and play against the computer - you'll only get a virtual sting if you lose!

Prerequisites: All you need is [Python] (http://www.python.org/download/releases/3.0) to play

Clone the project, navigate to the directory - <code>cd directoryname</code> - and run the game.py file in a Python3 Terminal window for Mac/ Linux

The rules are the same as the classic game:

  1. Paper covers Rock.   
  2. Scissors cuts Paper.   
  3. Rock smashes Scissors.  

**Choose your weapon wisely! You only have 3 lives!** 

The computer chooses first; just follow the prompts.

Built with [Python3](http://www.python.org/download/releases/3.0).

Enjoy!
